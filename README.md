# editdata.org

Edit tabular data from GitHub repositories.

## About
editdata.org repurposes components from [flatsheet](http://github.com/flatsheet/flatsheet) to provide an editor for tabular data that is hosted on github.com.

Currently the app is limited to editing & publishing data from gists (and actually that feature is currently under development. Check back soon.).
